# FxSmtpServer
This project was relatively quick born since I used to use FakeSMTP (https://nilhcem.com/FakeSMTP/) but it went offline/archived. So I decided due to lack of alternatives to reborn this app with a slightly more modern stack. 

It uses the same SubEthaSMTP (https://github.com/voodoodyne/subethasmtp) Server and the principal of this application is heavy orientated on FakeSTMP.

The technologies used are JavaFx, Kotlin, Javax.Mail build on top of JDK 17.
